RepX respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through its compliance with this Privacy Policy. This policy describes:
- The types of information that RepX may collect from you when you access or use its application.
- RepX's practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.

Please read this policy carefully to understand RepX's policies and practices regarding your information and how RepX will treat it. By accessing or using RepX's Services and/or registering for an account with RepX, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you are consenting to RepX's collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information as described here. If you do not provide the information RepX requires, RepX may not be able to provide all of its Services to you.

We are responsible for the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information in accordance with our privacy standards as well as any applicable laws. Your data controller may transfer data to other members of RepX as described in this Privacy Policy. RepX may process and retain your personal information on its servers in India.

This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of RepX's Services after RepX makes any change is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

----------------------------------------
The information we collect and how we use it
----------------------------------------

RepX collects several types of information from and about users of our Services, including:

1) Personal Information ("PI")
   Personal Information is the information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person, either from that data alone or in combination with other information. We do not consider information that has been anonymized or aggregated so it can no longer identify an individual to be personal information.

We collect this information:
- directly from you when you provide it to us; and/or
- automatically as you navigate through our Services.

Information You Provide to Us
The information we collect on or through our Services may include:
- Account information: username and password (used for authentication), your full name, postal code and other information you may provide with your account, such as your mobile phone number and email address.
- Your content: information you provide through our Services (for example, records you create or upload).
- Support and correspondence: any information you provide when you contact support.

We use the information you provide to:
- Allow you to securely log in and access your account.
- Provide, operate and improve our Services.
- Personalize your experience and support features you request.
- Provide customer support and respond to your queries.

Information Collected Automatically
We may also automatically collect:
- Device data: device model, operating system, app version, and similar diagnostic data.
- Usage data: actions you perform in the app, timestamps, and logs necessary for app functionality and troubleshooting.

-----------------------
Information from Third Parties
-----------------------
We may collect, process and store identifiers associated with any third-party account you use to sign into or connect with the Services. When you connect a third-party account (if applicable), you consent to our collection, storage, and use, as described in this Privacy Policy, of the information made available by that third party.

-----------------------
How we use the information we collect
-----------------------
We use the information for purposes including:
- To operate and maintain the Services.
- To provide authentication and account management.
- To improve and personalize the Services.
- To provide customer support.
- For analytics and performance monitoring.
- For any other purpose with your consent.

-----------------------
How we share the information we collect
-----------------------
We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide in the following ways:
- To affiliated entities under common control of RepX as necessary to deliver Services.
- To service providers (such as Firebase/Google Cloud) that perform functions on our behalf (storage, analytics, authentication). These providers only process data to help us provide the Services and are contractually bound to protect your information.
- To comply with legal obligations, law enforcement requests, or to protect rights, property or safety.
- With your consent or at your direction.

RepX does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

-----------------------
Data Storage and Security
-----------------------
- RepX uses Firebase (Google Cloud Platform) for authentication and data storage. Google operates under its own privacy policy and security controls; please review Google's documentation for details.
- We implement reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards intended to protect your personal information.
- Passwords used for authentication are protected using standard hashing practices (and not stored in plain text).
- No security measure is perfect; we cannot guarantee absolute security of data.

-----------------------
Data Retention
-----------------------
Your data will be retained for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide Services. When you delete your account, RepX will delete your personal data from active systems within a reasonable timeframe and as required by applicable law.

-----------------------
Accessing, Reviewing, Changing or Deleting Information

You may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in your account by contacting support. We will take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of information we maintain.

If you wish to request access, correction, data portability, or deletion, contact us at the address below. We will handle requests in accordance with applicable law.

Children's Privacy
-----------------------
RepX is intended for users aged 16 years and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children below 16. If you believe a child under 16 has provided personal data to RepX, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.
